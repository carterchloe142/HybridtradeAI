          Hybrid cycles run for 14 days. Profits are credited at Day 7 to your Withdrawable Balance. Principal unlocks at Day 14
          and can be withdrawn thereafter. Principal remains locked during the cycle.

          Withdrawals from the Withdrawable Balance can be requested at any time, subject to KYC approval and rate limits. Large
